                Geometrický obrazec poskládaný z kvádrů šedých a cihlových budov, přeplněné popelnice pitvořící se ze dna bezedné
                propasti pode mnou ohraničené betonem bez chuti, bez tvaru; přichází jaro. Stejně jako každým rokem venkovní vzduch se
                začíná nesměle oteplovat a kdybych z okna viděl nějaké stromy, tak mi to lehkým pokyvováním holých hlav potvrdí. Cítí
                konec zimy, která letos byla mírná a usměvavá, bez sněhu, bez slz, ale i přesto se její odchod už všichni těší. Stromy
                na to až se zase budou moct pochlubit bujnou kšticí rozcuchaných listů, nebojácně natřásající se ve větru velkoměsta, a
                já sám vlastně ani nevím na co. Stejně jako každým rokem mě změna, co smrdí ve vzduch zastihává nepřipraveného, ve
                zmuchlaném pyžamu za lehoulince ušmudlanou tabulkou skla s ještě stále zalepenýma očima medem nočních snů, které jsem
                tak jako každou noc už v tuhle chvíli už zapomněl. I po dvaceti dvou letech života se stále divím tomu, že se dny
                najednou bez vysvětlení začnou prodlužovat, tak jako stíny se zapadajícím sluncem, a všechno je najednou o něco
                krásnější.
                <br><br>
                Není to kvůli tomu, že bych o změně ročních období nevěděl, tak jako každý jsem ve čtvrté třídě základní školy viděl
                pestře vyvedené ilustrace v učebnici Přírodovědy a poslouchal věčně trpělivou Paní Učitelku, snažící se tento zázrak
                zjednodušeně vysvětlit. Chápu, že se naše planeta v rytmu waltzu půvabně obtáčí okolo Slunce, které se na ní galantně
                usmívá, někdy o něco víc a někdy zase o něco méně. Překvapí mě každoročně kvůli tomu, že mi skrze barevnou výměnu
                okolních kulis násilně připomene, že čas plyne.

                S každým novým lístečkem, jenž vypučí na větvičce stromu jsem zase o
                něco starší – s každým vykvetlým kvítkem růže v Kensingtonských Zahradách mi vypadne jeden vlas. Čas plyne, jako
                Heraklitova mystická řeka, nikdy do ní nevstoupím podruhé, to proto, že v ní budu už navždy plavat.

                Dívám se ven z okna do prostorů kanceláří nějaké nadnárodní firmy a jímá se mě jarní úzkost. Jestli pak ta dáma oblečená
                v profesionálním sáčku sedící za MacBookem, kterou pozoruji bez ostychu jako leguány v teráriích Zoologické Zahrady v
                Tróji, taky ve vzduchu cítí jaro? Těším se na odchod zimy, ale přesto nemám radost z příchodu jara, jelikož po něm
                přijde léto. V létě se všechno na chvíli zastaví, to jak horký vzdych roztaví postupně všechny naše starosti a tak máme
                chvilku na to si jen tak hrát, dojít společně s kamarády na Petřín a kochat se obzorem, pozorovat svět. V létě je čas na
                to se bez ostychu opít, porušit pár zákonů, poznat lásku svého života, poznat novou část světa, ležet na ručníku na
                koupališti a číst si, zahrát si volejbal, jít se projít, zavřít očí, propotit triko, usmívat se na lidi.
                <br><br>
                Jímá se mě jarní úzkost, protože je tohle léto jedno z posledních. Poslední možnost se posadit na zem v opojení
                absolutní svobody, jelikož za chvíli už budu muset do práce, vzít si hypotéku a stát se dospělým člověkem plně
                fungujícím v rámci kapitalistické společnosti.

                It is always enlightening to see my old mates from highschool. Our lives, which used to be so similar and dependent on
                one another, now often consist of events which hardly bear any resemblance whatsoever. And although the personalities
                might have remained mostly unchanged, the environmental variation we faced individually inevitably trickled down and
                altered some of our core values. Consequently, even though our infrequent interactions are still surprisingly seamless,
                there are the occasional “aha” moments when one realises that his close friend might not be completely aligned with him.
                <br><br>
                While observing significant differences between ourselves and strangers is a quite common occurrence, discovering
                disparities between us and our close ones can be much more destabilising. First thing that naturally comes to mind is
                the legitimacy and fragility of the relationship itself. Second, arguably an even more derailing aspect, is the
                questioning of one's own worldview. Since there likely is some level of respect which you hold for your friend, it is
                not as easy to disregard their novel input as it would be in the case of a complete stranger. Suddenly, it becomes much
                harder to remain ignorant to whatever novelty you have been made conscious of. This might be one of the greatest
                advantages of staying in touch with your old friends. Even though your lives may not be entangled as much as they used
                to be, there is an immense potential to continue to learn from one another. By separating, you have given each other the
                opportunity to get out of the bubble that was your friendship, a bubble which often led to mindless self-validation,
                rather than an exploration of new ideas.
                <br><br>

                I contemplate often how big of a role pure chance played in the progressive changes between my peers and I, and to what
                extent the different paths we all took were already predetermined by our nature. It seems to me, looking back at the
                last few years when I have been separated from the ones closest to me, that chance had almost everything to do with the
                changes in my perspectives. In the end, I did not really know what kind of environment I was signing myself up for when
                I was choosing my university, and I certainly had no idea what sort of people I would encounter and be influenced by. It
                seems fair to assume that my case is not an exception.
                <br><br>
                The belief that we are able to shape the environment around us and craft our path as we please may be, to a large
                extent, an illusion. We all are the products of chance. Often, we do not do what we have carefully planned out for
                ourselves ahead, but merely react to the randomness that life throws at us. However, although we are constantly and
                involuntarily shaped by what is happening in our close vicinity, we can choose how vulnerable we are going to be to
                these external forces. This does not mean we should disregard them, but rather acknowledge that they only form a tiny
                subset of what experiencing life can mean. Changing in the light of new experiences is inevitable (and also reasonable),
                but staying open to what we do not see is a decision one must actively work for.

                Besides being the most cliché form of beauty in nature, sunsets are also unique in that they are the subject of probably
                the most unsuccessful photographs. By that I mean attempts at capturing reality that completely miss the mark. Turns out
                it’s tough to make a camera sort through the abundance of colour in a way that remains appealing to the eye. But we love
                to try. This urge in us to carve out an instant, to create a believable lookalike of the moment, is what ends up
                preventing us from perceiving it. The actual click of the shutter takes us out of the reality, because we remove our
                attention from the view, giving it to the camera. I think it will be sad when we create phones that easily seize
                sunsets. There won’t be much everyday reality left untouched to experience.
                Lately I’ve felt more sensitive to what draws me into reality and what smudges it out. I could easily make technology
                the culprit. Spend an hour on my phone and for a couple hours after feeling like I’m not quite present. Like I must
                squeeze my hand to check that I’m physically here, because mentally it’s a slight haze. Yet the information-beaming
                pixels are only one form of what I replace reality with.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps in my thoughts and talks I stay connected to actual things. Still, it seems so banal to recollect what I heard
                or tasted without connecting it to other experiences and trying to uncover the similarities or patterns. Again, I enjoy
                leaving the layer closest to now and transforming it into systems or concepts. In conversations and contemplations, it
                is more stimulating, fun – and probably this process of departing from reality through our minds is what is necessary to
                do art or math or say jokes. So, as I feel like reaching some general truths about my surroundings, I’m just pressing
                the shutter.

                To make the appreciation of good debate worse, my dad told me that when we argue and I make a better argument than him,
                it still does not mean I’m right. Which initially sounded like he’s just trying to avoid accepting my point of view but
                turns out a good argument is not truth. Now I must ask if when I talk about anything with someone and we reach an
                exciting conclusion, did we do that only because it was the end of a random direction we chose to pursue? So how can I
                know if my conversation has any value if it’s built on abstract concepts and does not even fold them into any truthful
                shapes? What about any of my thoughts?
                <br><br>
                Maybe I’m addicted to escaping reality through ideas or technology. I’m not sure if that would be bad or an essential
                part of being human. Nonetheless, this switching between reality of the tangible and intangible makes me wonder how much
                spending time in one affects the capacity to experience the other.

                Since I’m assuming most of you will tackle this rather broad theme from a life-change perspective (and since I have
                become rather exhausted contemplating about the uncertainty and change that I am currently going through in life on a
                daily basis) I will try and approach this topic from a bit of a different angle.
                <br><br>
                One of my courses this semester is called “Organisational change”. Bit of an ambiguous title if you ask me. What does
                organisational change even mean? Well, basically the nature of work has been constantly changing over the past couple of
                hundred years as organisations need to meet the challenges and pressures of the modern world. The main themes of this
                module are how are organisations changing and how to approach change from an organisational perspective, but in this
                short text, I would like to relate organisational change to our future careers. So how will our careers be different
                from the ones of our parents and what sort of benefits and challenges will we face? First of all, our jobs will be more
                flexible. Do you want to work from home? Sure, go ahead. Do you want to work 4-days a week? Sure, go ahead (as long as
                you meet your targets). Do you want to go for a 2-month long trip across Asia? Sure, go ahead (as long as you’ll work
                even harder when you come back). Sounds rather appealing. But. Secondly, our careers will be way more uncertain. There
                will no longer be a thing such as a life-long career (very common in the current Czech Republic) due to firms having to
                more effectively match capacity to demand. So, if you are struggling with uncertainty and change in your current life
                (similarly to me), perhaps it’s time to face them head-on, as the sooner we learn how to handle constant change and

                uncertainty, the better equipped we will be for the future labour market. Are you excited about the jobs of the future?
                And do you think that increased flexibility/increased uncertainty is a worthy trade-off?

                On a bit of a different note. There is a major change in technical regulations in F1 this season. Such a change only
                happens around once every decade or so and usually decides what team will be dominant in the upcoming years. F1 is a
                very inequitable sport full of positive feedback loops, so it is incredibly exciting that all teams will be starting
                “from scratch” and have a similar chance at coming up with a design, which will bring them success in the foreseeable
                future. Who will best adapt to the new regulations? Mercedes? Red Bull? McLaren? And who will win the title? Hamilton?
                Sainz? Alonso? No one knows. Everyone has a shot at winning.
